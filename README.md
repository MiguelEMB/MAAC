# MAAC - Algorithmic Bot using Machine Learning

Our project focuses on developing and implementing algorithmic trading strategies using machine learning techniques. We collect and organize relevant financial data, including market prices, trading volumes, and news sentiment. The data undergoes preprocessing to ensure quality and handle missing values. We then apply feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful information from this financial data.

## Project Analysis Overview

In our project, we aim to develop and implement profitable algorithmic trading strategies using machine learning techniques. This involves collecting and organizing financial data, including market prices, trading volumes, and news sentiment. The data is then preprocessed to ensure quality and handle missing values. Following this, we apply feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful information. The performance of our trading strategies and machine learning models is evaluated through backtesting and metric analysis.

## Data Preparation

The Data Preparation phase involves determining the input data, which includes historical price data from Yahoo Finance and technical indicators such as volume and exponential moving averages. This section further outlines the development of entry and exit rules, the incorporation of risk management techniques, and the implementation of order execution logic. Finally, the algorithm is tested and validated through backtesting and paper trading.

## Algorithm Backtesting

This section describes the process of backtesting the MAAC algorithmic bot using historical price data of 'AAPL' (Apple) stock obtained through the Yahoo Finance API. It explains the computation of pivot points based on high, low, and close prices, and how these points help determine support and resistance levels. It also outlines how trading signals are generated and how trading orders are executed.

## Neural Network Modeling

This section focuses on the use of neural network models in the MAAC algorithmic bot. It explains how pivot points are calculated and how support and resistance levels are determined. The bot generates signals by comparing the stock's low and high prices with the support and resistance levels, enabling informed buy or sell decisions.

## Results

This section provides an overview of the results obtained from the analysis, algorithm backtesting, and neural network modeling. It presents key findings, performance metrics, and insights gained from applying the MAAC algorithmic bot in simulated trading environments.

## Conclusion

The conclusion section summarizes the project's findings and key takeaways. It highlights the strengths and limitations of the MAAC algorithmic bot and discusses its potential for enhancing trading outcomes and decision-making processes. It also provides recommendations for further improvements and future research areas.

## Future Statements

This section outlines potential future developments and enhancements for the MAAC algorithmic bot. It explores the possibility of incorporating advanced machine learning techniques, expanding the range of trading strategies, and adapting to evolving market conditions.
